# Welcome to ComposeDB
ComposeDB on Ceramic is a decentralized, composable graph database! It provides a set of Typescript libraries and tools that allow developers to rapidly build applications on [Ceramic](https://ceramic.network/) — including the ability to discover, create, share and reuse composable data models using [GraphQL](https://www.graphql.org/).

## Overview
ComposeDB on Ceramic is a composable graph database built for Web3 app developers:

-  **Graph database** – Store and query data from a powerful graph, similar to Neo4j’s property graph database

-  **Easy to use –** Write your models as GraphQL schemas and connect your app using intuitive GraphQL APIs

-  **Data composability –** Reuse models from the marketplace to bootstrap your app with data, unlocking limitless data composability within ComposeDB’s open data ecosystem.

-  **Sign in with Web3 –** Securely authenticate users with wallets from Ethereum, Solana, and other popular blockchains.

-  **Powered by Ceramic –** ComposeDB is built on Ceramic, a mutable layer for IPFS with anchoring on Ethereum for finality.



## Build powerful Web3 applications
ComposeDB on Ceramic powers Web3 applications and use cases, such as:

- Decentralized identity – profiles, credentials, reputation systems

- Social networks – social graphs, posts, likes, comments

- DAO tools – proposals, tasks, contribution graphs

- Information graphs – knowledge graphs, science graphs

- … and so much more
